## More details will be given in the future..

## Intro
This repository contains an assignment in the Computational Geometry course that took place during my master's degree. More specifically, given RGB-D images, our first goal was to reconstruct the 3D surface and generate a 3D mesh object. That was performed using the ICP algorithm while achieving faster convergence using filtering techniques. Later, a segmentation technique was implemented to distinguish between the different 3D mesh objects applying two methods. The first refers to a region growing algorithm using normal vectors, while the last and better one utilizes the SVD technique.
